# Changelog 1.0.0-26.1

## 🌙 Initial Release (Targeting 26.1-snapshot-4)

**True Sleep** arrives for the latest Minecraft snapshots! This mod overhauls the sleeping mechanic to be physically simulated rather than a simple time skip.

### ✨ Features

* **Time Warp:** Sleeping now accelerates the game loop to ~500 TPS instead of skipping to day.
* **Simulation integrity:** Furnaces, crops, copper oxidation, and entity movement continue to process rapidly while you sleep.
* **Visuals:** Watch the moon and stars streak across the sky from your bed.
* **Multiplayer:** One player sleeping speeds up the world for everyone.

### 🛠️ Fixes & Parity

* **Cat Gifts:** Patched `Cat` logic to ensure they still give morning gifts (Phantom Membrane, etc.) even though the night passes in <5 seconds.
* **Nether Safety:** Sleeping in the Overworld no longer breaks if other players are in the Nether/End (Dimensions with no players are ignored).

### 📦 Dependencies

* Minecraft: `26.1-snapshot-*`
* Fabric Loader: `>=0.16.9`
* Java: `25`
