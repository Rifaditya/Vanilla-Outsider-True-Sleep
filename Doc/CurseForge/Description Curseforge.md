# 🌙 True Sleep (Now for 26.1 Snapshots!)

**No Backports:** I will **NOT** backport this mod to older versions (1.21, 1.20, etc.). Please do not ask.

In vanilla Minecraft, sleeping is a "cheat code" that deletes time. You right-click a bed, the screen fades to black, and the game instantly skips forward 12,000 ticks.

**Vanilla Outsider: True Sleep** changes this foundation. When you sleep, the world **accelerates**. Instead of skipping the night, the game tick rate boosts to **500 TPS** (25x speed). You watch the moon zoom across the sky, stars streak by, and the sun rise rapidly.

## ✨ Features

### 🕰️ Simulation

The world doesn't pause. Furnaces continue to smelt, crops continue to grow, and copper continues to oxidize while you sleep. Everything simulates at hyper-speed.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike other "Time Skip" mods, this literally runs the game loop faster. Your machines will process materials while you sleep!

### 🎞️ Visuals

Watch the passage of time from your bed. No jarring "fade to black." The transition from night to day is seamless and grounded in the world.

### ⚖️ Multiplayer

One player sleeping accelerates time for *everyone* on the server.

* **No more arguments:** "1/2 players sleeping" doesn't force a skip.
* **No disruption:** Other players just see the world speed up for a few seconds.

### 🐈 Cat Gifts

We've patched the vanilla Cat logic!
Normally, cats only give gifts if you sleep for 5+ seconds. True Sleep is so fast the night passes in 1 second.
**We fixed this:** Your cats now recognize the "Time Warp" and will still grant you Morning Gifts (Phantom Membranes, Rabbit Feet, etc.).

### 🛡️ Safety

Sleeping in the Overworld works perfectly even if other players are exploring the Nether or End. The mod intelligently ignores empty dimensions to prevent logic bugs.

## ⚙️ Config

The mod works out of the box with zero setup.

* **Config File**: `config/truesleep.json`
