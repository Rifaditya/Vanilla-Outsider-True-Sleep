  # True Sleep (Time Warp)
  ## Philosophy Fit
  This fits **Vanilla Outsider** perfectly because it repairs a broken simulation loop. In vanilla, sleeping "deletes" time—furnaces don't smelt, crops don't grow, and turtle eggs don't crack during the skipped night. By **Fast-Forwarding** ticks instead of skipping them, we preserve the "World Logic." It adds a tiny bit of friction (you have to wait a few seconds) in exchange for a massive consistency payoff (your machines actually worked while you slept).

  ## Mechanics
  ### Core: Tick Acceleration
  - **Mechanic:** When all players are in bed, the game does not set time to Morning. 
  - **Action:** Instead, it increases the `tick rate` (MSP) drastically (e.g., 100x or 200x speed) until Morning is reached.
  - **Visuals:** The sun/moon visibly streak across the sky. Shadows move rapidly.

  ### Immersive Benefits
  - **Production:** Furnaces, Blast Furnaces, and Smokers continue processing fuel/items at the accelerated rate.
  - **Growth:** Crops, Saplings, and Baby Animals age rapidly during the sleep cycle.
  - **World:** Entities move in fast-forward (funny but logical).

  ## Assets Needed
  - [Visual: Motion Blur shader for the sky (Optional)]
  - [Logic: Tick Rate Handler (similar to Carpet Mod's warp)]
